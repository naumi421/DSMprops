This folder houses scripts used to help analyze and assess SOLUS
predictions

**gNATSGO_compare_soildepth.R:** Script to create maps of soil depth to
bedrock from both gNATSGO and SOLUS to enable comparison.

**gNATSGO_compare.R:** Script to allow comparison of gNATSGO, SOLUS, and
other soil property datasets.

**results_analysis.R** Script used synthesize performance results
accross all SOLUS models and create tabular and figure outputs.

**sCV_update.R:** Script that updates spatial cross validation
comparisons for SOLUS models. This was needed to update results after
gNATSGO training points were added to the model building workflow.
